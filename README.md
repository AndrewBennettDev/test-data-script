This is a quick bash script to create data for testing. This will create a main directory, any number of subdirectories,
then any number of files within each subdirectory. Personal application is for testing sharing/permission changes within
a SaaS integration, but this can easily be edited for other purposes.

Useage:
Clone repo, save in bin or script folder, make executable (chmod +x ./testDataScript.sh), then run from your preferred directory.
You will be prompted to create a Main Directory, a subdirectory name, number of subdirectories, file base name, and number of files
per subdirectory. Script will then run and create directories and files.
